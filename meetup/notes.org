Simple Emacs based presentations
- run entirely in Emacs usng [[https://github.com/eschulte/epresent][EPresent]] (via ELPA)
- uses Org-mode markup
- looks pretty good
- simple navigation using:
- "left arrow" "right arrow", "f" "b", "n" "p" for next and previous slide;
- "j" "k" for scrolling;
- "t" for top;
- "q" for quit.

* Formatting Source Code

*EPresent* is an Emacs library sourced on Github with more than one
fork. Here's the main code found in Eric Schulte's fork, nicely
formatted for an Emacs Lisp audience:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;;;###autoload
  (defun epresent-run ()
    (interactive)
    (unless (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
      (error "EPresent can only be used from Org Mode"))
    (setq epresent--org-buffer (current-buffer))
    (epresent--get-frame)
    (epresent-mode)
    (epresent-top))
#+end_src
* Showing TeX/LaTeX snippets

Kinetic Energy:

\begin{equation*}
  e = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
\end{equation*}

Note: this will only work if you've installed a TeX distribution!
* Tables and Spreadsheets
